A Google Chrome extension that reflect on the connectivity between individuals pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. I hope this extension could uplift you and give you a sense of peace and assurance amid the social distancing fatigue. Inspired by yasai and made with p5.js

### Other Chrome extension concepts I am interested in creating
* “Everyone is a musician”: I want to create an extension that each time you type a letter/click mouse, there’s a random musical note generated. In that case if you are typing an essay, you might actually create a song!
* An extension that reminds users of their daily screen time.
* An extension that allows you to type in one sentence/paragraph each day, and that sentence will automatically pop up after one month on your screen.
* Pet: you can have a virtual pet living in your browser and it “reads the battery.” Whenever your laptop’s power drops under 20%, the pet cries. And if the power is over 80%, the pet celebrates.
