      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      1. At a time when most people use outside forces (social media, website designer, algorithm, etc.) to manipulate personal website, what are the benefits of creating a website from scratch? And why do people continue to choose to use these “manipulators?”<br>
2. In the past, who set the “netiquette” and who is allowed to? How about now?<br>
3. What changed the internet landscape (from unmediated environment to mediated, designed, sponsored messages)?

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      
      1. Is User experience a concept exclusive too webs or products? What are some other fields that adopt this concept? (Film, game…)<br>
2. How did the social meaning of whiteness and blackness affected technological standards in the 60s?<br>
3. What is the biggest breakthrough the program designers made in order to make computer more accessible to laypeople? What is the role of user interface in this process?

      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      1. Is privacy dead? <br>
2. How should we understand and cope with the tension between surveillance and the desire to be noticed?<br>
3. Aside from the “privacy” aspect of surveillance, how about the “policy” aspect? Who gets to decide who should and should not be surveilled, and can we choose to be watched or not?
      
       <h2>Week 4</h2>
      1. How is digital/internet archive different as a forensic/journalistic approach to truth than an artistic approach? <br>
2. How does Internet Archive as a form of expression help push the urgent conversation?<br>
3. Is internet neutral? Who should be operating the Internet Archive/Wayback Machine, and does the operator’s identity affect the objectivity of the internet archive?

       <h2>Week 5</h2>
      1. Is meme only a Gen Z/millennial thing? Was there an alternative to meme before the internet became a thing?<br>
2. How are people who are less active on social media/have less access to it marginalized or underrepresented in the conversation of memes and other topics?<br>
3. How could a picture/screenshot’s quality affect its authenticity in today’s discourse of fake news? For example, would people more easily to question a blurred screenshot than a clear one? What is the meaning behind this?
      
      <h2>Week 6</h2>
     1. What are some other examples of non-inclusive applications or technologies that are widely used in our daily life? What are the consequences if we don’t fix those technologies?<br>
2. Should a creator of the technology/system be responsible for making sure the system does not marginalize certain groups?<br>
3. Should we embrace technology that are inherently biased (meaning the technology is unfair and flawed to certain groups), if the technology is beneficial to the majority of people?
      
      <h2>Week 7</h2>
    1. How do we turn data trauma into data healing? Do we as users have the autonomy to choose to be healed or hurt by the digital space? <br>
2. There are many examples of using technology to advocate for social issues, but is there any example of technology pushed forward by activism?<br>
3. What are some other aspects we need to consider other than the ones mentioned by Olivia in “How to Write Non-Violent Creative Code”? Why should we always stop the work and rethink those questions, and how could an overlook of those questions lead to violent code?
      
      
      <h2>Week 8</h2>
      1. Should there be no place for algorithm in policing? How do we balance the benefits of technologies (e.g. increasing efficiency) and the downside of algorithms that target minorities?<br>
2. What is the role of “big data” in today’s society? Some data can be used to help highlight the minority, but some other data can be manipulated or used to serve the privileged. How do we decide ‘how much data-driven tech should we use in policing?”<br>
3. How do we empower minorities (black, women, LGBTQ, etc) when the discussion around those people are seldom led by themselves?
